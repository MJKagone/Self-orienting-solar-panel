Course project for 'Principles of Digital Fabrication'. A solar panel that maximizes the amount of energy produced by always facing itself towards the sun.*

The project consists of an Arduino Uno, two ambient light sensors and a stepper motor powered by AAA batteries, as well as the panel itself. A laser cut box was made to house the electronics and a stand for the panel was 3D printed. The Arduino is programmed to turn the motor in the correct direction so that both sensors should receive approximately an equal amount of light, making the panel between them face towards the greatest source of light.

See [presentation.pdf](presentation.pdf) for a more comprehensive overview that was presented at the end of the course.

<sub>*The solar panel is not actually used to produce any electricity, as this was not an electrical engineering course. </sub>
